## How It Works

Suno Shuffle is designed to be as lightweight as possible:

1. **Simple Integration**: Adds a shuffle button to Suno's playlist interface
2. **Instant Shuffling**: Click the button to randomize the track order
3. **Page Refresh**: The page will automatically refresh and apply the new order and begin playing!
4. **No Tracking**: Works entirely in your browser with no data collection

> **Note**: The page refresh is intentional and necessary to ensure the new track order is properly applied in Suno's player. Will try to make this worker better in a future release!
